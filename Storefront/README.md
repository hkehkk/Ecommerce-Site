This project gave me the opportunity to construct a web project that serves as a storefront for a small business. I created a multi-page website that includes a shopping cart and checkout. This will give the business what it needs to sell their products outside of their community. This was the first time I worked with client-side programming but will not be the last. 
To start this project, I viewed many other storefront websites to get an idea of what should be included on the website. I narrowed it down to the topics specific that were relevant to the small business. I was able to successfully create a shopping cart that held price value. I was also able to add framework from another company to take payments. 
I was able to complete this project from beginning to end. I used a few resources for HTML and CSS formatting. I have learned that HTML is quite versatile as it can be used on multiple platforms. I learned that I enjoy working with HTML and CSS because the creation possibilities are endless. Key factors that lead to the success of this process were: using the knowledge I gained from class work, finding helpful resources when I needed them, and trial and error.
If I were to do this same project over again, I would focus less on the designing aspect until functional coding is finished. I would also give myself more freedom to design. Overall, the project was successfully accomplished, and I am pleased with the outcome.
